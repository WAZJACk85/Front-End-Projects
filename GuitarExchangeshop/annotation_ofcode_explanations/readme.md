Overview of Annotated explanations behind build and code engineering:-





As I am just starting to construct this document I thought I would first explain and annotate the Javascript behind the Search and filter option on the website:

Here is the code:-

Firstly I took a common piece of filter code with an 'oninput' keyword to facilitate a starting set of code.  I found that this example I found on github was very concise code compared to some and worked well,

I then looked at different keywords to assist in making it behave as an 'onclick' search.  KEYWORD 'onchange' helped make the click search work after the text is changed, rather than as it is being typed.  I then experimented with the onclick features and eventlistners. (more info to come)  but after testing, I decided to use the 'onsubmit' as this collaberated better with the onchange KEYWORD and also with the current code SYNTAX.
